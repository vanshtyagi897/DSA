Trees: 
    1.Non-Linear DS
    2.Trees can be defined as collection of nodes linked together to simulate hierarchy.
    3.Nodes are connected through parent-child relationship.

    Root: Top-most element in the tree.
    Leaf Nodes(external nodes): Don't have any child.
    Non-Leaf Nodes:  Have atleast one child.  

    Ancestor: Any predecessor node on the path from root node to that node.
    Descendant: Any successor node on the path from that node to leaf node.

    Siblings: children of same parent.
    Degree of a Node: No. of children of that node.
    Degree of tree: Max degree among all nodes of the tree.
    Depth of a node: No. of nodes path from root to that node.
    Height of a node: No. of edges in the longest path from that node to leaf node.
    Level of a node = Depth of a node
    Level of a tree = Height of a tree

    No. of edges = (n-1),    n= no. of nodes
